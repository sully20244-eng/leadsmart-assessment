📁 This Folder – Project Summary (Interactive Roadmap)

This folder contains the complete summary of the entire project, structured as a clear roadmap that includes all requirements from the task.

I built the summary using HTML instead of a static PDF so that the content is interactive, easier to navigate, and more user-friendly.
The goal is to make the whole project easier to understand and follow step by step.
