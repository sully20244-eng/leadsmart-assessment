# Leadsmart Assessment

This repository contains my end-to-end solution for the Leadsmart data assessment:
exploration, dashboard, modeling, strategy, AI agent design, and production plan.

- Data files are under `data/`
- Notebooks and apps are organized per part (Part 1–6)
- `campaign_leads.csv`: one row per lead, with campaign_id, lead_status, added_date, user_id, project_name…
- `campaigns.csv`: campaign metadata, including daily_budget and project_name.
- `insights.csv`: daily performance metrics (spend, impressions, clicks) per campaign.
- `lead_status_changes.csv` (optional): historical lead status transitions.

All notebooks assume these files are located under `data/`.
