In this file, you’ll find **two HTML files for Part 5**:

1. **The main architecture file** – this is the file that actually implements the required logic and structure for Part 5.
2. **The demo file** – a simplified version that visually demonstrates the concept and how the idea works.

Both files together give you the full picture:
the **architecture** (how it works) and the **demo** (how it looks).
